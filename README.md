# ux-lab

### Dependencies

UX-Lab uses a CSS preprocessor [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and a handy Sass framework, [Compass](http://compass-style.org/). When you install Compass, Sass is included as a dependency. Here are the Compass installation instructions: http://compass-style.org/install/

### Compile Sass

Here's how to compile Sass stylesheets to CSS:

* Change directories into the cloned UX-Lab git repository
* To compile the Sass, run: ```compass compile```
* Alternatively, if you'd like compile Sass stylesheets automatically to CSS when the file is changed, use: ```compass watch```
