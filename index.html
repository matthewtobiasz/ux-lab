                <h5>Farmington, UT</h5>
                <p><span>Scariest feature:</span> A 116-degree drop. Yup.</p>
                <p><span>Height/max speed:</span> 208ft/70mph</p>
                <p>Cannibal isn’t even open yet, and it’s already scaring the bejesus out of us (seriously, can we borrow some of your bejesus?). Its 116-degree drop is one of the world’s steepest, and it careens passengers directly through a tunnel that dives headlong into a 208ft tower.</p>

                <p><span>Height/max speed:</span> 181ft/70mph</p>
                <p>You’ll be seeing red after riding wooden powerhouse El Toro (and possibly nothing at all during it; your eyes might close due to sheer exhilaration), and there’s no denying that its 70mph speeds are impressive, especially since you’ll feel weightless for so much of the ride (wooden roller coasters are good at this sort of thing).</p>

                <h3>Fury 325</h3>
                <h4><a href="https://www.carowinds.com/" target="_blank">Carowinds</a></h4>
                <h5>Charlotte, NC</h5>
                <p><span>Scariest feature:</span> Tallest traditional chain-lift roller coaster in the world at 325ft</p>
                <p><span>Height/max speed:&nbsp;</span>325ft/95mph</p>
                <p>Fury 325 is so-named because it’s 325ft tall (and not, in fact, because it tried to get the AIM screen name “Fury” and was told it had already been taken), and the first ascent feels like an eternity, partially owing to the fact that the older chain-lift technology really amps up the feeling of anticipation. Once you’re barreling down the first 81-degree drop at 95mph, though, you’ll become immediately aware of how much precious time you have left on this thing.</p>

                <h5>Sandusky, OH</h5>
                <p><span>Scariest feature:</span> Tallest and fastest wing coaster, with six inversions</p>
                <p><span>Height/max speed:</span> 170ft/67mph</p>
                <p>The wing seats of GateKeeper at Cedar Point (the Mecca of roller coasters in America) flare out on either side of the vehicle, so you’re basically flying already as you navigate the myriad twists and turns of this coaster. You’ll also pass through two extremely narrow keyholes, so if you’re Shawn Bradley, maybe sit this one out.</p>

        <h3>What are Roller Coasters?</h3>
        <p>A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the "Russian mountains" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more inversions (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.</p>
